# Chess-Program (Broken)
This project has been imported from my college OneDrive and is currently not working due to corrupted/missing files, needs to be fixed.
A chess program with a minimax algorithm that allows it decide its move up to 7 steps deep. The chess game currently is missing special rules such as en passant. castling and pawn promotion. The program also has an account system so that users can track their stats. It is also possible for users to save their games progress.
